                        <br />
                        After relocating to Sweden with my wife, I changed
                        fields from Biology to data and programming. From
                        2018-2019 I worked as a Data Analyst for Radisson Hotel
                        Group in Sweden and currently work as a BI developer for
                        Radisson Hotel Group in Belgium (while still being based
                        in Sweden).

                        <br />
                        We have a 1-year-old son (Jack) and are currently living
                        in Solna. In my spare time I like to play tennis and
                        learn new things (usually related to programming).
