                        After relocating to Sweden with my wife, I changed
                        fields from Biology to data and programming. From
                        2018-2019 I worked as a Data Analyst for Radisson Hotel
                        Group in Sweden and currently work as a BI developer for
                        Radisson Hotel Group in Belgium (while still being based
                        in Sweden). I love learning new technologies and working
                        with data.
