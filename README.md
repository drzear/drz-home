## Hey, this is my personal website repo for drzear.github.io

I'm using it as a way to learn React. I'll also be trying typescript with React in this project to see how they go together (I'm coming from Angular).

### Concepts practiced in this app:

-   React
    -   Routing in React
    -   Code splitting
    -   Interactive charts in React
    -   Typescript in React
-   Deploying SPA on Github pages

Useful commands:

-   npm start (run locally)
-   npm run build (build project)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
