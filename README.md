## Hey, this is my personal website repo

I'm using it as a way to learn React (overkill for a personal website, I know).
I'll also be trying typescript with React in this project to see how they go together (I'm coming from Angular).

Useful commands:

run locally: npm start

build project: npm run build

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
